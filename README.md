## Introduction

This application is built using the Python programming language, PyCaret library, and Streamlit framework to create an application that helps find optimal machine learning algorithms and models for classification problems.

## Features

- **Upload Datasets**: Users can easily upload training and testing datasets in CSV format. This allows for integration of data from various sources.

- **Visualization**: The application provides charts and graphs to

This application is designed to optimize the machine learning process using AutoML (Automated Machine Learning). It leverages the Python programming language, PyCaret library, and Streamlit framework to build a user-friendly application for finding optimal algorithms and machine learning models for classification problems.

## Features

- **Upload Datasets**: Users can easily upload their training and testing datasets in CSV format. This allows for seamless integration with various data sources.

- **Visualization**: The application provides visualizations to help users understand and explore their datasets. This includes the ability to view dataframes, charts, and other visual representations of the data.

- **AutoML Model Training**: The application automates the model training process using the PyCaret library. It automatically explores various algorithms and configurations to find the optimal model with high accuracy for the classification problem.

- **Predictions and Download**: Once the model is trained, users can make predictions on new datasets. The application provides the ability to download the predicted data in CSV format for further analysis.

- **Model Saving**: The application allows users to save the optimal model for future use. This enables the model to be applied to new datasets without the need for retraining.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Launch the application by running the following command:
streamlit run app.py


3. Access the application by opening the provided URL in your web browser.

4. Upload your training and testing datasets in CSV format.

5. Explore the visualizations to gain insights into your data.

6. Initiate the AutoML process to find the optimal model for classification.

7. Make predictions on new datasets and download the results in CSV format.

8. Save the optimal model for future use.
