# AutoML-Streamlit
AutoML Machine Learning Application
This application is designed to optimize the machine learning process using AutoML (Automated Machine Learning). It leverages the Python programming language, PyCaret library, and Streamlit framework to build a user-friendly application for finding optimal algorithms and machine learning models for classification problems.

Features
Upload Datasets: Users can easily upload their training and testing datasets in CSV format. This allows for seamless integration with various data sources.

Visualization: The application provides visualizations to help users understand and explore their datasets. This includes the ability to view dataframes, charts, and other visual representations of the data.

AutoML Model Training: The application automates the model training process using the PyCaret library. It automatically explores various algorithms and configurations to find the optimal model with high accuracy for the classification problem.

Predictions and Download: Once the model is trained, users can make predictions on new datasets. The application provides the ability to download the predicted data in CSV format for further analysis.

Model Saving: The application allows users to save the optimal model for future use. This enables the model to be applied to new datasets without the need for retraining.
